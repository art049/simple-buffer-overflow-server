# Simple **stack buffer overflow** server

This simple C program (`main.c`) expose a stack injection vulnerablity. This program can also be run as a TCP server using the `make serve_vulnerability` command.

## Goal
The goal of this challenge is to run arbitrary code on the server's host machine exploiting the stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
